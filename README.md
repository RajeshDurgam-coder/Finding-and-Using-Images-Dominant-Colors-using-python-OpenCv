# Finding-and-Using-Images-Dominant-Colors-using-python-OpenCv
In this project, I have written code using python3 with OpenCV. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is released under a BSD license and hence itâ€™s free for both academic and commercial use. I used k-means clustering to cluster the colors instead of using histogram for each color of pixel.
